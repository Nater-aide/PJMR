# TCPView

TCP view is part of the sysinternals suite  

1. Launch your malware sample
2. Look in TCP view for the process name of the file you ran

Check for any listening addresses  
Document the port it is listening on  

Use Netcat to test against open port -- ```nc -nv (IP address of host) (open port you find)```
